<p>
    When Trafikito receives outputs of commands executed on your server it checks how many space the output takes. If
    the total size of all data is over your plan limit, Trafikito will replace the longest output with messages about
    it.

    When you are reaching any limit of the current plan, Trafikito will notify the workspace owner with an email
    message.
