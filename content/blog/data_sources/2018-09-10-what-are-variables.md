Variables are placeholders that represent particular values from the output of the command executed on your server.

<!--more-->

In the data source configuration view, you can add, edit or remove variables. Each variable is associated with one cell in the table of parsed output.

Double check the variable value source cell in the variable settings if:

*   You changed the command
*   The format of the command output changed
*   Delimiters were updated that specify how to split the raw output into a table of data
