Trafikito’s dashboard data, including server list and single server views, are continuously being refreshed in the background. A data refresh is performed every 30 seconds.

If a server is working as expected, new data will be available once per minute. You can leave the dedicated display view open and it will always show updated information.

You can also refresh data manually by refreshing the page or by clicking \[icon\] icon on the top right.
