With Trafikito you can monitor many Linux <wiki>servers</wiki> at once and organize them into <wiki>workspaces</wiki>. Even with the <wiki>free plan</wiki>, a single <wiki>workspace</wiki> can hold up to 10 <wiki>servers</wiki>. 

The <wiki>servers list</wiki> is automatically refreshed every 30 seconds, so you can keep it open on a separate screen to always see the <wiki>overview</wiki> of your machines.

The servers list is an overview of everything you have
------------------------------------------------------

In the <wiki>servers list</wiki> you can:

*   See if all servers are running smoothly
*   See if all servers are up and <wiki>sending data</wiki> to Trafikito
*   See if <wiki>Trafikito agent</wiki> is already installed and waiting for the 1st data to come
*   Get instructions how to <wiki>install</wiki> or <wiki>uninstall</wiki> Trafikito <wiki>agent</wiki> from your server

While on the servers list you can do and see a lot, you will notice that the interface is clean and there’s no visual noise.

If everything with the server is great - you will just see the server name with a green status on the left.
