Mass actions allow you to edit multiple notifications at once. To do it, follow these steps:

AAAAAAAAMOREAAAAAAAAAA

1.  Open the main menu on the top left \[menu icon\]
2.  Select **Dashboard**
3.  In the servers list find the server you want to edit and click **Open** next to it
4.  On the top right click **Settings**
5.  Use the Show button next to **Notifications** to show the notifications list.
6.  Use the checkbox before the notification name to **select notifications**

When one or more notifications are selected, mass actions will appear in front of the notifications list. These actions will update all the selected notifications at once.
