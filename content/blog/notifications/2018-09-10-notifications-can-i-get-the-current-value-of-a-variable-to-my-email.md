**Yes** you can. You can use any variable placeholders inside the body, URL or header value fields. Placeholders will be
replaced with actual value on a fly. Below all configuration options for notifications, you will find all your 
variables from all data sources. Click on any to copy. Variables must be surrounded by pairs of curly braces 
like this: `{{ram_used}}`
