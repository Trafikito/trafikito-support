1.  **Variable** - you have to select an existing variable to track from data sources
2.  **Range change** - you have to select one of the range change events
3.  **Stay in range** - defines how long a value has to stay in a new range before it triggers this when case
4.  **Wait before firing again** - you can set if when cases should be fired several times and how long to wait before firing again.
5.  **Allow this to fire at any time** - switch indicating if other “when” case must be fired on the same variable to fire again
