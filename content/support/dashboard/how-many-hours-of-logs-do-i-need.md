For hobby projects 12 hours is more than enough. With 12 hours you can see what happened while you were sleeping.
 However, for most **businesses 3 days is a must-have.**

There are many cases when people push updates on a Friday and everything seems ok but suddenly something crashes the 
server on a Saturday and on Monday It’s hard to tell what happened without the 3 days of logs because nobody reacted
to <wiki>notifications</wiki> over the weekend.

More than 3 days of logs is great to compare stats with previous days or weeks. When you deploy new performance updates,
 you must have statistics to measure the effectiveness of the update.

So, at the end of the day it all depends on your needs and how important your server is. For businesses we recommend the
 Medium plan and for hobbyists - the free plan is enough.
