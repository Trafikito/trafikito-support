This means you can use regular expression syntax as the delimiter. This is a very powerful way to split by anything in the text.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>E.g. default delimiter to split the row into columns is [,]+ which is a regular expression. It means</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>split by sequence of space or comma characters. There may be one or more of these in a row.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It will split text by any combination of spaces and commas. All these texts would be split into 3 columns with values “Foo” “bar” and “baz”:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Foo bar baz</li>\n<li>Foo bar baz</li>\n<li>Foo , bar baz</li>\n<li>Foo,bar,baz</li>\n<li>Foo, bar, baz</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more take a look at <a href=\"https://regex101.com/r/pTV5Ys/1\">https://regex101.com/r/pTV5Ys/1</a> which is a tool to write and test regular expressions.
